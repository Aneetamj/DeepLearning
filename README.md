# DeepLearning - Predicting Diabetes Progression using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

### Objective:
You are required to model the progression of diabetes using the available independent variables. This model will help healthcare professionals understand how different factors influence the progression of diabetes and potentially aid in designing better treatment plans and preventive measures. The model will provide insights into the dynamics of diabetes progression in patients.

### Dataset:
Use the Diabetes dataset available in the sklearn library.
